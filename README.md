# RL-for-CSPs

## Project Overview

This project aims to solve the N-Queens problem using two advanced approaches in reinforcement learning and sequence modeling: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Decision Transformers. The N-Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
